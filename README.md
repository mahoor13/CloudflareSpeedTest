Many foreign websites use Cloudflare CDN, but the IP addresses assigned to visitors in mainland China are not friendly (high latency, high packet loss, slow speed).  
Although Cloudflare has publicly disclosed all [IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/ips/), finding the suitable one among so many IPs can be challenging. Thus, this software was created.

**"Choose Your Preferred IP" to test Cloudflare CDN latency and speed, and get the fastest IP (IPv4+IPv6)! If you find it useful, give it a ‚≠ê!**

The following commands are just examples. Please check [**Releases**](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases) for version numbers and file names.

``` yaml
# If it is the first time, it is recommended to create a new folder (skip this step for subsequent updates)
mkdir CloudflareST

# Enter the folder (for subsequent updates, just repeat the following download and unzip commands from here)
cd CloudflareST

# Download the CloudflareST archive (replace [Version] and [Filename] in the URL according to your needs)
wget -N https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.2.4/CloudflareST_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# If you are downloading on a server in China, use one of the following mirrors for acceleration:
# wget -N https://download.fgit.ml/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.2.4/CloudflareST_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://download.fgit.gq/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.2.4/CloudflareST_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# wget -N https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/releases/download/v2.2.4/CloudflareST_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# If the download fails, try removing the -N parameter (if updating, remember to delete the old archive rm CloudflareST_linux_amd64.tar.gz)

# Unzip (no need to delete old files, they will be overwritten directly; replace [Filename] according to your needs)
tar -zxf CloudflareST_linux_amd64.tar.gz

# Grant execute permissions

# Run (without parameters)
./CloudflareST

# Run (with example parameters)
./CloudflareST -dd -tll 90
```
> If the average latency is very low (e.g., 0.xx), it indicates that CloudflareST is using a proxy during the speed test. Please disable the proxy software before testing the speed.
> If running on a router, it is recommended to disable any proxies in the router (or exclude them), as speed test results may be inaccurate/unusable.

Parameters:
    -n 200
        Latency test threads; the more threads, the faster the latency test. Devices with weak performance (such as routers) should not set it too high; (default 200, maximum 1000)
    -t 4
        Number of latency test times; the number of times a single IP's latency is tested; (default 4 times)
    -dn 10
        Number of download speed tests; after latency test and sorting, the number of IPs to perform download speed test, starting from the lowest latency; (default 10)
    -dt 10
        Download speed test time; maximum time for a single IP's download speed test; it shouldn't be too short; (default 10 seconds)
    -tp 443
        Specify the test port; the port used during latency test/download speed test; (default port 443)
    -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url
        Specify the test address; the address used during latency test (HTTPing)/download speed test. The default address is not guaranteed to be available; it is recommended to use a self-built address;

    -httping
        Switch test mode; change the latency test mode to HTTP protocol, and use the test address specified by [-url] parameter; (default TCPing)
        Note: HTTPing is essentially a kind of network scanning behavior. If you run it on a server, you need to reduce concurrency (-n), otherwise, it may be temporarily suspended by some strict service providers. If you encounter a situation where the number of available IPs is normal during the first HTTPing test, but it decreases or even directly becomes 0 in subsequent tests, but it recovers after a while, it may also be recognized as a temporary restriction mechanism triggered by the carrier or Cloudflare CDN due to network scanning. Therefore, it will recover after a while, and it is recommended to reduce the concurrency (-n) to reduce the occurrence of this situation.

### Interface Explanation

To avoid misunderstanding the **output content during the speed test process (usable, queue numbers, interruption during half of the download speed test?)**, I specifically explain it.

```
# For those who have just started using CloudflareST, you might be confused: **There were 30 usable IPs in the latency test, but why are there only 3 left at the end?**
What does the queue in the download speed test mean? Do I have to wait in line for the download speed test?

CloudflareST will perform latency tests first, and during this process, the progress bar on the right will real-time display the number of available IPs (`Available: 30`). However, note that this available quantity refers to the **number of IPs that passed the test without timing out**, unrelated to latency upper and lower limits, or packet loss conditions. After the latency test is completed, due to specifying latency upper and lower limits and packet loss conditions, only `10` IPs remain (waiting for download speed tests, i.e., `Queue: 10`).

So, in the example above, after the latency test of `321` IPs is completed, only `30` IPs passed the test without timing out. Then, based on the latency upper and lower limits (`40 ~ 150 ms`) and packet loss upper limit conditions, only `10` IPs that meet the requirements remain. If you have disabled download speed test (`-dd`), then these `10` IPs will be directly output. However, in this example, the download speed test is not disabled, so the software will continue to perform download speed tests on these `10` IPs (`Queue: 10`).

> Because download speed tests are done one by one in a single-threaded manner, the number of IPs waiting for download speed determines the `queue`.

****

> You may have noticed: **You specified to find 5 IPs that meet the download speed conditions, but why did it "interrupt" at 3?**

In the download speed test progress bar, `3 / 5`, the former indicates that `3` IPs meeting the download speed lower limit conditions (i.e., download speed above `1 MB/s`) have been found. The latter `5` indicates that you requested to find `5` IPs meeting the download speed lower limit conditions (`-dn 5`).

> Additionally, it is worth noting that if you set `-dn` greater than the download speed test queue, for example, after the latency test, only `4` IPs remain, then the numbers in the download speed test progress bar will both be `4`, not the `5` specified by `-dn`.

After the software finishes testing these `10` IPs, it found only `3` IPs with download speeds above `1 MB/s`, and the remaining `7` IPs are "not qualified."

So, it's not "it interrupts before reaching 5 every time," but rather all IPs have completed the download speed test, but only `3` IPs meeting the conditions were found.

****

If you don't want to encounter a situation where there are not many IPs meeting the conditions after all the tests, you can **lower the download speed upper limit parameter `-sl`**, or remove it.

Because as long as the `-sl` parameter is specified, the speed test will continue until the specified number of `-dn` (default 10) is reached or all IPs have completed the test. Removing `-sl` and adding `-dn 20` will only test the latency of the top 20 IPs with the lowest latency and stop after testing, saving time.

****

In addition, if all IPs in the queue have completed the test but none of them meet the download speed conditions, then it will **directly output the download speed results of all IPs in the queue**. This way, you can see the download speeds of these IPs, and then **try lowering `-sl` appropriately**.

Similarly, for latency tests, the values of `Available: 30` and `Queue: 10` can tell you whether the latency conditions you set are too strict for you. If there are plenty of available IPs, but after filtering conditions, only 2 or 3 remain, then it's clear that you need to **lower the expected latency/packet loss conditions**.

These two mechanisms, one tells you about **latency and packet loss conditions**, and the other tells you about **download speed conditions**.

### Usage Examples

On Windows, specifying parameters requires running in CMD or adding parameters to the shortcut target.

> **Note**: All parameters have **default values**, and parameters using default values can be omitted (**choose as needed**).  
> **Tip**: In Windows **PowerShell**, just change `CloudflareST.exe` in the command to `.\CloudflareST.exe`.  
> **Tip**: For Linux systems, just change `CloudflareST.exe` in the command to `./CloudflareST`.

#### \# Run CloudflareST in CMD with Parameters

For those not familiar with the command-line program, you might not know how to run it with parameters. Let me explain briefly.

<details>
<summary><code><strong>„Äå Click to expand to see the content „Äç</strong></code></summary>

****

Many people opening CMD to run CloudflareST with an **absolute path** will encounter errors. This is because the default `-f ip.txt` parameter is a relative

 path and requires specifying the absolute path of ip.txt. However, this is too troublesome, so it is recommended to enter the CloudflareST program directory and run it with a **relative path**:

**Method 1**:
1. Open the directory where CloudflareST is located.
2. Right-click on a blank space, press <kbd>Shift + Right-click</kbd> to display the context menu.
3. Choose **\[Open command window here\]** to open the CMD window, which is now located in the current directory.
4. Enter the command with parameters, such as `CloudflareST.exe -tll 50 -tl 200` to run.

**Method 2**:
1. Open the directory where CloudflareST is located.
2. Directly select and enter `cmd` in the folder address bar, then press Enter to open the CMD window, which is now located in the current directory.
3. Enter the command with parameters, such as `CloudflareST.exe -tll 50 -tl 200` to run.

> Of course, you can also randomly open a CMD window and then enter something like `cd /d "D:\Program Files\CloudflareST"` to enter the program directory.

> **Tip**: If you are using **PowerShell**, just change `CloudflareST.exe` in the command to `.\CloudflareST.exe`.

</details>

****

#### \# Run CloudflareST with Parameters using Windows Shortcut

If you don't often modify the run parameters (such as usually directly double-clicking to run), it is recommended to use a shortcut, which is more convenient.

<details>
<summary><code><strong>„Äå Click to expand to see the content „Äç</strong></code></summary>

Right-click the `CloudflareST.exe` file - **\[Create Shortcut\]**, then right-click on the shortcut - **\[Properties\]**, and modify its **Target**:

```bash
# If you don't want to output result files, add -o " " (quotes contain a space, without a space, this parameter will be omitted).
D:\ABC\CloudflareST\CloudflareST.exe -n 500 -t 4 -dn 20 -dt 5 -o " "

# If the file path contains quotes, place the startup parameters outside the quotes, and remember there is a space between quotes and -.
"D:\Program Files\CloudflareST\CloudflareST.exe" -n 500 -t 4 -dn 20 -dt 5 -o " "

# Note! The shortcut - Start in location cannot be empty; otherwise, it will not find the ip.txt file due to the absolute path.
```

</details>

****

#### \# IPv4/IPv6

<details>
<summary><code><strong>„Äå Click to expand to see the content „Äç</strong></code></summary>

****
```bash
# Specify the built-in IPv4 data file to test these IPv4 addresses (the -f default value is ip.txt, so this parameter can be omitted).
CloudflareST.exe -f ip.txt

# Specify the built-in IPv6 data file to test these IPv6 addresses
# Additionally, starting from version 2.1.0, IPv4+IPv6 mixed speed testing is supported, and the -ipv6 parameter has been removed. Therefore, a file can contain both IPv4+IPv6 addresses.
CloudflareST.exe -f ipv6.txt

# You can also specify the IP to be tested directly through parameters.
CloudflareST.exe -ip 1.1.1.1,2606:4700::/32

> When testing IPv6, you may notice that the number of tests varies each time. Understand the reason: [#120](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/issues/120)
> Because there are too many IPv6 addresses (in the order of hundreds of millions), and the vast majority of IP ranges are not enabled, I only scanned a part of the available IPv6 ranges and wrote them to the `ipv6.txt` file. If you are interested, you can scan and add/delete them yourself. ASN data source is from: [bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net/AS13335#_prefixes6)
```

</details>

****

#### \# HTTPing

<details>
<summary><code><strong>„Äå Click to expand to see the content „Äç</strong></code></summary>

****

There are currently two latency test modes: **TCP protocol** and **HTTP protocol**.
The TCP protocol takes less time and consumes fewer resources, with a timeout of 1 second; this is the default mode.
The HTTP protocol is suitable for quickly testing if a certain domain points to a certain IP, with a timeout of 2 seconds.
For the same IP, the latency obtained by each protocol generally follows: **ICMP < TCP < HTTP**, with the rightmost being more sensitive to network fluctuations such as packet loss.

> Note: HTTPing is essentially a kind of **network scanning** behavior. If you run it on a server, you need to **reduce concurrency** (`-n`), or you may be temporarily suspended by some strict providers. If you encounter a situation where the first HTTPing test has a normal number of available IPs, but the subsequent tests have fewer and even become 0, but it recovers after a while, it may be due to triggering a temporary restriction mechanism by the ISP or Cloudflare CDN for **network scanning**. It will recover after a while. It is recommended to **reduce concurrency** (`-n`) to reduce the occurrence of this situation.

> Also, this software's HTTPing only obtains **response headers**, and does not retrieve the content of the body (i.e., the URL file size does not affect HTTPing tests. However, if you still want to perform download speed tests, you will need a large file).

```bash
# Just add the -httping parameter to switch to HTTP protocol latency test mode.
CloudflareST.exe -httping

# The software will determine the availability based on the effective HTTP status codes returned when accessing the webpage (of course, timeout is also considered). By default, responses with 200, 301, and 302 HTTP status codes are considered valid. You can manually specify the HTTP status code considered valid, but only one can be specified (you need to determine in advance which status code the test address will return under normal circumstances).
CloudflareST.exe -httping -httping-code 200

# Use the -url parameter to specify the HTTPing test address (it can be any webpage URL, not limited to a specific file address).
CloudflareST.exe -httping -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url
# If you want to HTTPing test other websites/CDNs, then specify an address that uses that website/CDN (because the default address is Cloudflare's and can only be used to test Cloudflare's IP).
```

# After specifying the region name, the results obtained after the latency test will all be IPs of the specified region (you can continue to perform download speed tests).

```bash
# If you want to test ports other than the default 443, you need to specify them using the -tp parameter (this parameter will affect the port used for latency testing/download speed testing).

# If you want to latency test port 80 + download speed test (if -dd disables download speed testing, it is not needed), you also need to specify an http:// protocol download speed test address (and the address will not be forcibly redirected to HTTPS because that will be port 443).
CloudflareST.exe -tp 80 -url http://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5952/movie_max.webm

# If it is a non-80 443 port, you need to make sure that the download speed test address you are using supports access through that non-standard port.

CloudflareST.exe -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url

# Note: If the test address is HTTP protocol (the address cannot be forcibly redirected to HTTPS), remember to add -tp 80 (this parameter will affect the port used for latency testing/download speed testing).

#### \# Custom Test Conditions (Specify the Target Range for Latency/Packet Loss/Download Speed)

<details>
<summary><code><strong>„Äå Click to expand to see the content „Äç</strong></code></summary>

****

> Note: The "available quantity" on the right of the latency test progress bar refers only to the number of IPs that did not time out during the latency test and is unrelated to the latency upper and lower limit conditions.

- Specify only the **[Average Latency Upper Limit]** condition

```bash
# Average latency upper limit: 200 ms, download speed lower limit: 0 MB/s
# That is, find IPs with an average latency below 200 ms, and then perform 10 download speed tests in ascending order of latency.
CloudflareST.exe -tl 200
```

> If **no IP meets the latency** condition, nothing will be output.

****

- Specify only the **[Average Latency Upper Limit]** condition and **only latency testing, no download speed testing**

```bash
# Average latency upper limit: 200 ms, download speed lower limit: 0 MB/s, quantity: unknown
# That is, only output IPs with latency below 200 ms and no longer perform download speed tests (because no longer performing download speed tests, the -dn parameter is invalid).
CloudflareST.exe -tl 200 -dd
```

- Specify only the **[Packet Loss Upper Limit]** condition

```bash
# Packet loss upper limit: 0.25
# That is, find IPs with a packet loss rate less than or equal to 0.25, with a range of 0.00 to 1.00. If -tlr 0 is specified, it means to filter out any IPs with packet loss.
CloudflareST.exe -tlr 0.25
```

****

- Specify only the **[Download Speed Lower Limit]** condition

```bash
# Average latency upper limit: 9999 ms, download speed lower limit: 5 MB/s, quantity: 10 (optional)
# That is, 10 IPs with an average latency below 9999 ms and a download speed above 5 MB/s must be found to stop the speed test.
CloudflareST.exe -sl 5 -dn 10
```

> If **no IP meets the speed** condition, it will **ignore the condition and output all IP speed test results** (convenient for adjusting conditions for the next test).

> If you **do not specify the average latency upper limit**, and the number of IPs that meet the condition is not reached, it will continue to test the speed indefinitely.
> So, it is recommended to **simultaneously specify [Download Speed Lower Limit] + [Average Latency Upper Limit]**. This way, if the test is not enough to meet the latency upper limit, it will stop the speed test.

****

- Specify both the **[Average Latency Upper Limit] + [Download Speed Lower Limit]** conditions

```bash
# Both the average latency upper limit and download speed lower limit support decimals (such as -sl 0.5).
# Average latency upper limit: 200 ms, download speed lower limit: 5.6 MB/s, quantity: 10 (optional)
# That is, 10 IPs with an average latency below 200 ms and a download speed above 5.6 MB/s must be found to stop the speed test.
CloudflareST.exe -tl 200 -sl 5.6 -dn 10
```

> If **no IP meets the latency** condition, nothing will be output.
> If **no IP meets the speed** condition, it will ignore the condition and output all IP speed test results (convenient for adjusting conditions for the next test).
> So, it is recommended to run the test once without specifying conditions to see the approximate range of average latency and download speed to avoid specifying conditions that are too low or too high!

> Because the IP ranges published by Cloudflare are **origin IPs + anycast IPs**, and **origin IPs** cannot be used, so the download speed is 0.00.
> You can add -sl 0.01 (download speed lower limit) at runtime to filter out **origin IPs** (results with download speeds below 0.01MB/s).

#### \# Test a Single or Multiple IPs Separately

<details>
<summary><code><strong>„Äå Click to expand to see the content „Äç</strong></code></summary>

****

**Method One**:
Specify the IP range data to be tested directly through parameters.
```bash
# Enter the directory where CloudflareST is located, and then run:
# Windows system (run in CMD)
CloudflareST.exe -ip 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/24,2606:4700::/32

# Linux system
./CloudflareST -ip 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/24,2606:4700::/32
```

****

**Method Two**:
Alternatively, write these IPs in any text file in the following format, for example, `1.txt`

```
1.1.1.

1
1.1.1.200
1.0.0.1/24
2606:4700::/32
```

> For a single IP, you can omit the `/32` subnet mask (i.e., `1.1.1.1` is equivalent to `1.1.1.1/32`).
> The subnet mask `/24` refers to the last segment of this IP, that is, `1.0.0.1~1.0.0.255`.

Then run CloudflareST with the startup parameter `-f 1.txt` to specify the IP range data file.

```bash
# Enter the directory where CloudflareST is located, and then run:
# Windows system (run in CMD)
CloudflareST.exe -f 1.txt

# Linux system
./CloudflareST -f 1.txt

# For IP ranges like 1.0.0.1/24, only the last segment will be random (1.0.0.1~255). If you want to test all IPs in this range, please add the -allip parameter.
```

#### \# One-stop Acceleration for All Websites Using Cloudflare CDN (No Need to Add Domains to Hosts One by One)

I've mentioned before that the purpose of developing this software project is to accelerate access to websites using Cloudflare CDN through **modifying the Hosts file**.

However, as mentioned in [**#8**](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/issues/8), adding domains to Hosts one by one is **too troublesome**, so I found a **one-stop solution**! You can check this [**Still adding Hosts one by one? Perfect local acceleration method for all websites using Cloudflare CDN is here!**](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/71) and another [tutorial on modifying domain resolution IP to a custom IP using local DNS service](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/317).

****

#### \# Automatically Update Hosts

Considering that many people need to replace the IP in the Hosts file after obtaining the fastest Cloudflare CDN IP.

You can check this [**Issues**](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/312) to get **Windows/Linux automatic update Hosts script**!

## Manual Compilation

<details>
<summary><code><strong>„Äå Click to expand to see the content „Äç</strong></code></summary>

****

For convenience, I write the version number into the code's `version` variable during compilation. Therefore, when you manually compile, you need to use the `-ldflags` parameter after the `go build` command to specify the version number, like this:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=v2.3.3"
# Run this command in the CloudflareSpeedTest directory via the command line (e.g., CMD, Batch script), and you can compile a binary program that can run in an environment with the same system, bit, and architecture as the current device (Go will automatically detect your system bit and architecture) and the version number is v2.3.3.
```

If you want to compile for **other systems, architectures, and bits** on a Windows 64-bit system, you need to specify the **GOOS** and **GOARCH** variables.

For example, to compile a binary program suitable for **Linux system amd architecture 64-bit** on a Windows system:

```bat
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=v2.3.3"
```

For example, to compile a binary program suitable for **Windows system amd architecture 32-bit** on a Linux system:

```bash
GOOS=windows
GOARCH=386
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=v2.3.3"
```

> You can run `go tool dist list` to see which combinations are supported by the current Go version.

****

Of course, for convenience of batch compilation, I will specifically set a variable for the version number, and subsequent compilations can directly call this version number variable.  
At the same time, for batch compilation, you need to separate them into different folders (or use different file names), and you need to add the `-o` parameter to specify.

```bat
:: For Windows system:
SET version=v2.3.3
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o Releases\CloudflareST_linux_amd64\CloudflareST -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=%version%"
```

```bash
# For Linux system:
version=v2.3.3
GOOS=windows
GOARCH=386
go build -o Releases/CloudflareST_windows_386/CloudflareST.exe -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=${version}"
```
